            <li>What's the best way to get the body-wrap (or other div) to cover the whole page? 
              There are so many different answers on the internet and I kind of just picked one, 
              but is there a general best practice?
            </li>
            <li>Right now, I have the background image repeating, but the tiles can get partially cut off on the last row and colum depending on screen size. 
              If I wanted the individual tiles to resize according to screen size so that no parts of the last tiles get cut off, 
              how would I do that, without horrifically distorting the image?
